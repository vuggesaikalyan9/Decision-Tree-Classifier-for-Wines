Introduction
A classifier in machine learning is an algorithm that automatically orders or categorizes data into one or more of a set of classes. There are supervised and unsupervised classifiers. Supervised classifiers are fed training datasets, from 
which they learn to classify data according to predetermined categories. Unsupervised machine learning classifiers are fed only unlabeled datasets, which they classify according to pattern recognition or structures and anomalies in the data.

Implementation
In this project I will implement in Python a decision tree classifier for wines. The data set for the training consists of 3 different types of wines

Deliverables
two files: the code P3_G01369862.py and a report P3_G01369862.pdf. 
After implementation, run the classifier using the data set for training. The classifier is at least 90% accurate.
